        <p>The below table has few food recommendations that I have tried in Kansas city which I like and would recommend you to try. These are avaible in and aroud kansas, the intresting part is these are budget friendly. My suggestion is get some starters like karivepaku chicken which is mouthwatering, spicy and so good. Post get biryani of your choice in Godavari because every biryani is great. In the last to complete a good meal with desert have gulabjamun or for better digestion get coke from nearby gas station.</p>
