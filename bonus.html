        <h1 style="color:red;">Daniel Gillies Elijah</h1>
        <p>Elijah is described as unpredictable, overprotective and stubborn, but also very kind, intelligent, selfless, empathetic, compassionate, and friendly. It has been noted by Rebekah herself that as Elijah was always moral, his morality was only amplified as an Original. He is thus known as being the most moral of his siblings, apart from Finn, though recently Elijah has proven himself to have long since exceeded even his older brother's morality. He is extremely loyal and has a loving and forgiving nature but can easily prove himself to be very manipulative, though he is far more forgiving than Klaus. He strongly believes in trust, honesty and loyalty and whenever he would give his word to someone, he would keep it, as he has said "I'm a man of my word". Only when he realized he was lied to would Elijah break a deal, as they have theoretically proven themselves to go against him, such as in his deal with Sophie Deveraux. He is very praiseworthy, respectful, and admirable for human life, which is unseen in many other vampires and is normally very reluctant to kill anyone when unnecessary. Elijah has an open-minded and optimistic personality. When he meets Elena, he respects her bravery and willingness to endanger herself for her loved ones.</p>
